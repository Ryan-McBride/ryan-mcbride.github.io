What makes a great playlist for productivity?

If you walk into a software company anywhere in the US, there's a good chance that everyone will be wearing headphones. There is an important reason for this, and that's to prevent distractions. Distractions are the biggest threat to software engineers. One funny comment from a colleague can do serious damage to your train of thought. Even as I write this, I regret not putting on my headphones, because there are at least 10 interesting conversations I could join.

However, if you listed to the wrong music while you code, it can be just as distracting. Personally I can't code to anything with words. Listening to words while I'm trying to write just makes me take twice as long to write. This limits the scope of listenable music a fair bit, but fortunately the amount of music on the internet is practically infinite.

Here's a list of music that I would recommend for coding productively:

[MUSICFORPROGRAMMING();](http://www.musicforprogramming.net/)
This is a favorite of mine. Every couple of months a new hour long mix of instrumental music is added. In general the mixes are pretty mellow, so this is great for when youre coding in a relaxed environment and really just need to focus.

[INSTRUMENTAL HIP-HOP](https://open.spotify.com/user/miggiesmalls/playlist/69Sk0ME4PgFDPgit7401Dh)
For a long time this was my go-to coding playlist. Definitely more upbead than MUSICFORPTROGRAMMING();, but not too crazy. This can help you work yourself into a groove and blast out those awesome JavaScript functions in style.

[KATAMARI DAMACY SOUNDTRACK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAA6hq9RL-4)
Katamari is a super awesome videogame for the PS2. One of its best features is it's upbeat and unique soundtrack. I like to listen to this when I'm coding in the morning because it helps work me into a good mood. We've all coded while miserable before, and anyone can tell you that the code that results is less than great. Whenever I'm upset, but I still need to bust out some code, this is what I listen to.

[LIGHTNING BOLT](https://open.spotify.com/album/1HN2Y71apfstJXoWxDPTJO)
This is my last resort. This is my "The Deadline Was Yesterday" playlist. My "Everything Is On Fire" playlist. It's harsh, heavy, groovy, and perfect for when you need to code fast. It's not technically instrumental, but the words are incomprehensible, so it's not too distracting. This band has gotten me to more deadlines than I'd like to admit, but it's definitely not for everybody.

[BONUS: MY SPOTIFY PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/user/peenmaster/playlist/28Op22YOEHh7gs8J8NYj2r)
This is my personal spotify coding playlist. It's got a lot of different genres, but for the most part it's perfect for coding.
