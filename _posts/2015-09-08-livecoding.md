A few years ago people laughed at the idea of watching strangers play videogames. They weren't laughing when Twitch.tv got bought by Amazon because of its massive success. People like watching other people do things well. It doesn't matter if it's sports, videogames, or even coding. If someone is good at something, and has a good personality, it's fun to watch them.

This brings us to livecoding.tv. Livecoding.tv is a community for programmers to watch other programmers live. At first that may seem weird or boring, but it's actually entertaining and informative. Watching an advanced programmer jam on a huge project is interesting to watch. Watching someone new to programming working through problems is also interesting. If you like code, there is no downside to watching others write it.

The numbers aren't quite as high as Twitch, but it's still a young community. In a few years it may be normal to see various meetups and screencasts pull in huge numbers.

The chat feature offers instant feedback between the streamer and the audience. Both parties can ask questions, get feedback, and offer help to each other.

Additionally, beyond the entertainment and educational benefits, Livecoding.tv is a great tool for practice. It's easy to let a day slip by without coding when you don't have anyone relying on you. When you have a schedule to keep and an audience to please, you're more likely to put in the work.

Once I graduate TGA I'll definitely be streaming my projects. I still have a great stream setup left over from when I used to stream videogames. Until then, I'll be interacting via chat. See you on the interwebs.
