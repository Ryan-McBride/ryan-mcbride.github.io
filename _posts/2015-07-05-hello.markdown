Hi. My name is Ryan and this is my dev blog. I'm currently enrolled in Telegraph Academy Cohort[0]. It's an honor to be in the first class, and the instructors and my cohort mates are all amazing. I've learned more about coding in the past week than I have in 6 years of working in QA and Software Strategy. It's hard to believe that only one week has passed, and 12 weeks feels like a lifetime, but I'm excited to have this opportunity.
