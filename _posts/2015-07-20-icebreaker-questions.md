**In videogames, min-maxing is the practice of optimizing something as much as possible**. You don&#39;t put magic points on a fighter. Min-maxing is second nature for a developer. We dedicate large portions of our day to trying to make things efficient. It&#39;s not rare to spend hours of time to save ten&nbsp;minutes later.

While this practice is helpful with coding, it usually bleeds into other areas. Take for example the&nbsp;question&nbsp;&quot;If you could only eat one food for the rest of your life what would it be?&quot; The average person, when met with this question will just name their favorite food. Yet developers will take this as a challenge.

&quot;Does the food have to meet all nutritional requirements? If I pick chocolate ice-cream will I die of scurvey after a few months? Am I allowed to drink water?&quot; Devs will immediately start trying to hack the question to get the best response. This usually causes the question asker to rephrase their question several times.&nbsp;

At this point the question shifts towards what the answerer is least likely to get sick of. &quot;Does air count as food? Can I just drink water forever?&quot; While devs will have fun with this questions, it&#39;s often frustrating to everyone else.

You should definitely hang out with devs at parties. But unless you have some free time, avoid hypotheticals.
