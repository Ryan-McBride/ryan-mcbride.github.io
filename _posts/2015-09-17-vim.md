Every engineer has a favorite text editor. The two that there is the most evangelism around are Vim, and Emacs. This post isn't to say which is better, because neither is better. The best text editor is the one with which you are most productive. I am most productive with Vim, so that is what I use. You can read my post about how dumb the evimacs wars are [here](http://ryanmcbri.de/not_code,/fun/2015/08/31/evimacs.html).

Vim boasts that given enough practice, engineers can code at the speed of thought. I'm not quite there yet, but it's definitely been a great experience for me. The only downside is that I accidentally use Vim hotkeys anytime I'm writing text anywhere. The power of Vim is how customizable it is. No two Vim environments are the same. I'll be going over some of the basics, but keep in mind while you read, that you can change literally everything to your liking.

##You've (probably) already used Vim
If you've done a git commit without changing your default you've probably been met with a text editor that wouldn't let you enter text, until suddenly it entered a whole bunch of text. Then you probably weren't able to quit. This was Vim. Because this first contact is without context, a lot of people start off hating Vim. Once you take the time to learn it though, there's a good chance you'll never go back.

##You quit with :q! or :wq
A lot of the power with Vim is that there are hotkeys and text commands for just about everything. On top of that, you can create incredible complex commands that run at a keypress. A few hotkeys I've made are using 's' to save, and 'qq' to quit. These have become such second nature, that I often hit 'esc - s - qq' to attempt to send a tweet. This isn't as annoying as you might think. Muscle memory is rarely a bad thing.

##You want gitgutters? You want minimaps?
On top of the command customization, Vim has thousands of optional plugins to create an incredibly personalized experience. You can install a gitgutter to show you when you've edited a line that hasn't been committed, custom syntax highlighters, directory navigators, [powerlines](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline), anything that you could possibly imagine. (I will concede that Vim doesn't appear to have the ability to view Google Maps in window, which Emacs can do.)

##You look like you know what you're doing
This is also true of Emacs, Sublime, or any text editor that allows you to do most navigation without the mouse. The mouse is slow, clunky, and makes you look unsure. If you can touchtype and know exactly where your hotkeys are, you look like you're straight out of Hackers.

Once you get used to the Vim hotkeys, you can bring them to your browser with the [Vimium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimium) plugin. I love using this plugin, because I hate using my mouse unless I'm playing a videogame. In college when my CS professor was teaching us about input devices, on a test we had to select what the most efficient input method is and I chose the keyboard. The answer he was looking for was the mouse. He was and still is wrong.

##Suggested Reading
If you want to get started with Vim, there are tons of resources out there. The best way to learn is to just start using it, and when you find a point of friction, google how to fix/do it. For reference however you should check out the book [Practical Vim](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1934356980/stichtingiccfhol) but don't expect to read it cover to cover. Like most technical manuals, this is best used for reference.

There is also a reference app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llerrad.vimreference) which I like to use for pocket reference when I don't have internet access.

Finally you can check out my Vim environment on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryan-McBride/nvim-config). I update this periodically with my current settings. As I said at the beginning of this post, settings are incredibly personal, and are built up iteratively over time. Don't just clone my settings and expect to be a Vim superstar

##Don't be a Jerk
Learning new things are fun. But if you choose to learn Vim, please take the oath to not be one of *those* Vim users. Don't be a jerk to non-Vim users. Telling someone that your text editor is cooler than theirs doesn't make you cool. Just chill out and write code, no need to start a war.
