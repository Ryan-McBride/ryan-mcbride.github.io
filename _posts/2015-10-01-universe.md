I, like many other engineers in their mid-to-late twenties, am currently attending GitHub Universe. There are several things that I've noticed while I've been here:

1. Microsoft is having trouble moving their Visual Studio stickers
2. Many of the older people here were sent by their company, and are not excited about being here
3. Everyone is roughly as socially awkward as me, which is refreshing
4. I'm not used to receiving this much free stuff. It's almost an uncomfortable level of free stuff
6. Most of the people here are unemployed
7. It's really awesome

Many people use conferences like this to network, but this is the first conference I've attended that also has useful keynotes and presentations. At Apple or Google conferences, it's always just announcing new technology to luke-warm applause, and white dudes in turtle necks. GitHub Universe is different though.

There are 3 presentations going on at any given time, and all of them have something interesting to offer. There are lectures on CI, Deployment, Space, GitHub features, and more. It doesn't have the same feeling as an Apple keynote, which usually comes down to 'look at this dumb thing you have to develop for now'. I'm actually -learning- things and growing as an engineer.

So thanks GitHub. Thanks for being cool, and thanks for having your first big tech conference be awesome.
