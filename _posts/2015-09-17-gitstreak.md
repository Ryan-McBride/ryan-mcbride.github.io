title: The Psychological Impact of your Github Commit Streak

Git is one of the most important tools an engineer can have in their arsenal. If you've ever written anything larger than a Todo app, you understand why source control is important. GitHub provides free hosting (for open source projects), and also adds a human element to source control. Getting stars, forks, and followers on GitHub feels good, but there's another important social aspect that I'll be discussing in this post. The commit history graph.

This little green graph on your GitHub profile is the source of some discussion. It shows the open source commits, stars, pull requests, and a few other things that you've done on any given day of the current year. There are also some statistics about the current and longest streak of days on which you've had GitHub activity. This is not a 100% accurate system. Git dates can be spoofed, so streaks can be false. Some people use this to make pictures in their activity graph. The logic behind this is pretty simple. They run a script that condenses their git history on key days so that they can spell out words or draw pixel art. Things like this make the activity graph an inaccurate metric as to how much a person actually commits to GitHub.

Though the activity graph is too inaccurate to to show real seniority or productivity, it can still provide a vital service. Humans like to see numbers increase. This has been proven with videogame high scores, car mileage, twitter followers, etc. Every time we see a number increase due to an action we took, we feel good.

We can use this to our advantage. Marketers and other people that wright headlines would call this "One Simple Trick to Hack Your Brain". I recommend using your GitHub activity graph to convince yourself to code every day. Getting the longest streak possible won't necessarily help you find a job, but it will get you coding everyday, which can help build up an important habit. To effectively build a habit, you have to practice every day, and that is what buiding your activity graph can do. There is no point in cheating to keep your streak, as you will only be cheating yourself.

Use this tool to keep yourself motivated, and code every day. Even if it's just a blog post. Your activity streak won't get you hired, but being a badass coder that writes code every day will.
