# I drink Soylent, and enjoy the convenience.

I know many of the people that read that probably recoiled a tiny bit, but that's okay, that's what people do when I say it in real life too.

Soylent is a tricky subject, because it's so far removed from what people are used to. The average person eats solid food 3-8 times a day, and I have nothing against solid food. My problem is with the perception of food.

I enjoy food a fair bit. I also enjoy cooking and baking a great deal, but it's not something I enjoy worrying about every single day. I have to make my breakfast (which is usually just oatmeal, or a slice of dave's bread with peanut butter), pay 10-15 dollars for lunch each day (Working in Oakland is not cheap), or alternatively take time that morning, or the night before to prepare some sort of lunch for me to reheat at the office. Dinner isn't so bad, I have plenty of time when I get home from work, but what I then have to deal with is the cleanup. At least one pot or pan, a bowl, utensils, that's the best case scenario, and my water bill is high enough just trying to keep the color of the lawn not too brown for my landlady.

I feel like when put into perspective, and given the option, it almost seems silly to make so much work for yourself every single day just to eat. If I'm out with people, or hosting people, of course I will cook and buy food, but if it's a Tuesday afternoon and I don't have lunch plans with anybody, why wouldn't I just drink some tasteless drink from a bottle and go on with my day?

Soylent definitely has a stigma and it probably always will, thanks in no small part to the founder being kind of a weirdy, but the value it adds to my life is more important to me than people once in a while looking at me weird.

At it's heart, food is fuel for us. We eat it because we have to or we die. Indulging in something really delicious once in a while is good too, for our morale, but putting so much emphasis on all food having to be a delicious 3 course meal is just a waste of time, money, and food. Not to mention the epidemic of over indulgence has helped contribute to national obesity in no small way.

If more people thought of food as fuel just a little more often, I think they would not find the idea of Soylent so weird.

*drinks from plain white bottle*

Also Soylent 2.0 is a huge improvement over 1.5 so go at least try it out.
