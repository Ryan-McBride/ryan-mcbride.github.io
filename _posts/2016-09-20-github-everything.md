# GitHub is already one of the most powerful tools in an Engineer's utility belt.

The problem is that GitHub is like a really nice multitool, but most people only use it for one of the many jobs that it's good for. I'm going to catch some flack for saying that, because a common belief in the software world, is that every job has a best tool, and trying to use a different tool, is like using a screwdriver to drive nails.

This is true, the argument I am making is that GitHub is the best tool for more situations than it may seem at first.

## Here's what I use GitHub for:

1. Coding. This one is obvious. Everyone has used GitHub for this before. It's easy, fast, and ubiquitous.
2. Notes. Not just my notes, team notes. Many managers have always had a real love for using tools like confluence, or an internal wiki, or email chains to keep track of meeting notes. The general reasons for this hosting is to have the notes visible, editable, and shareable. These are all things that GitHub does well, and with the introduction of creating and editing files from the GitHub web app, even non-technical people can pick up this flow easily.
3. Sprint/Bug tracking. Github has a built in issue tracker, and while it's not as robust as Jira or Redmine or whatever other tool your manager insists you use, that's actually a plus. Using Jira is a huge pain. It's too customizable, and makes the simple task of reporting a bug, last way longer than it should. Title the issue, assign it, give it a sprint and a tag, and put whatever other relevant information in the description. It's very easy to do. If you absolutely need a scrum board, waffle.io integrates with github really easily, but it's not really necessary.
4. Documentation. Wikis really suck. Yes even your company's internal wiki. Especially if they require a separate account to view or edit. Want your build steps, documentation, code of conduct, even information hosted and editable? GitHub. You're already using it, just use it more.

Every project can fall victim to tool creep. It's like feature creep, but more meta. If you have too many tools, your onboarding process is going to suck. If you use GitHub for everything it's capable of, it won't be so bad. And where are the onboarding steps? GitHub.
