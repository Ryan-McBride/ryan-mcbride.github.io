Everyone knows that keeping your github streak  going can be a pain. You want to have a nice big number, but you also want to sleep. That's the boat I was in recently.

Luckily, in my lazy browsing of Reddit, I ran into a link to a github repo called [git-gud](https://github.com/fsufitch/git-gud). It's a fun python script that prints messages to the console when you type `$ git gud` or `$ git rekt`. While this app doesn't do any version control, it's fun. One could create a terminal alias instead, but git-gud is on pip which makes it easier.

While I was checking out the repo, I noticed there was a feature request. Several users wanted a 'git job' function to run when they're told to get jobs. I loved that idea, so I forked and cloned the repo right away. Python isn't my strong suit, but I managed to add git job in a few minutes. It wasn't until I was making my pull request that I realized what I had just done. After a long day of coding, I came home, had a beer, and did more coding. If you had told me last year that this is what I would be doing this year, I wouldn't have believed it.

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO MY LIFE.
